# Running Labs (KALI Linux) #
# I'm running all labs on  [Kali Linux 2024.3, 64Bit] ( https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-virtual-machines/ ) the latest version of Virtual Box image. 
## While some of the labs can be easily run on Windows you are better in the long run creating a KALI Linux Virtual Box using it for all of the labs.
